"The pinning policy governs whether we will consider saving information about "

"none policy turns off this behavior. Deny will try to use the pins we "
"already have, but will never connect to a server that has another "
"certificate. The add policy will always add new pins - by itself, this is "
"not so useful, but if you turn it off or change it to deny, you will have a "
"list of pins that you can curate later. The add first and ask after policy "
"will pin the first certificate we ever see, and then let the user know if we "
"encounter other certifacates. The add first and deny policy does the same "
"thing except it doesn't ever ask after the first certificate. Finally, the "
"ask policy will always ask what to do when seeing certificates we haven't "
"added."
